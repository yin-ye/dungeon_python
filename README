Run the game using:

python3 game.py

Your job, as in the assignment brief, is to write code that controls
Link.

To do that, your code needs to specify a value for the function
makeMove() in link.py to return. There are four legal values for
makeMove() to return:

Directions.NORTH
Directions.SOUTH
Directions.EAST
Directions.WEST

The simple code in link.py just moves Link towards the next gold in
the list.

You only need to write code in link.py to create your solution, but
you will also need to modify:

config.py

which allows you to change the configuration of the game --- change
the size of the grid, the number of pits, the number of Wumpus and so
on.

The rest of the files are as follows:

dungeon.py  -- draws the dungeon on the screen.

game.py     -- runs the game until Link wins or loses.

graphics.py -- simple Python graphics.

utils.py    -- utilities used in a few places.

world.py    -- keeps track of everything (used by Dungeon to draw).
